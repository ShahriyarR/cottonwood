# The Cottonwood Neural Network Framework

[Why another neural network framework?](https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/blog/171633/cottonwood-flexible-neural-network-framework)

Cottonwood is built to be tweaked. Fork it. Add to it. Customize it
to solve the problem at hand.

This code is always changing. I recommend referencing a specific tag
whenever you use it in a project.
