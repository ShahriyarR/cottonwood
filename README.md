# The Cottonwood Neural Network Framework

[Why another neural network framework?](https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/blog/171633/cottonwood-flexible-neural-network-framework)

Cottonwood is built to as flexible as possible, top to bottom.
It's designed to minimize the iteration time when running experiments
and testing ideas. It's meant to be tweaked. Fork it. Add to it. Customize it
to solve the problem at hand.

This code is always evolving. I recommend referencing a specific tag
whenever you use it in a project. Tags are labeled v1, v2, etc. and
the code attached to each one won't change.

### **v1**, initial state

The initial state of the code, as built in
[End-to-End Machine Learning Course 312](https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/p/write-a-neural-network-framework/).
The entry point is `python3 run_framework.py`.
